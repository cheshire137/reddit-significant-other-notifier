# Reddit Significant Other Notifier

This is a Chrome extension that will display notifications about new posts
and/or comments that your significant other makes on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com). No votes are made automatically since that would go against [the Reddit rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules), but you can upvote manually from within
the popup. A desktop notification is displayed for each new post. The extension
checks periodically for new content from the specified user; you can choose how
frequently it checks. Click the Reddit icon in your Chrome bar and a list of
past notifications will be displayed.
