# Reddit Significant Other Notifier

This is a Chrome extension that will display notifications about new posts that
your significant other makes on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com). No votes are
made automatically since that would go against [the Reddit rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules). A desktop notification is displayed for each new post. The extension checks every five minutes for new posts.

## To-do List

* Add a popup with a badge showing notification count, so if you don't see a desktop notification, you can see it in the popup.
* Allow tracking multiple significant others.
* Add options to change how often the extension checks for new content.
